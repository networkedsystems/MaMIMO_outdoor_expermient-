This repository includes Matlab scripts to process the uplink channel data collected in an outdoor experiment using KULeuven Massive MIMO testbed.

Authors: Andrea P. Guevara, Cheng-Ming Chen. 2018

## Instructions

1. Select your MaMIMO antenna distribution (collocated or distributed) according each outdoor experiment detailed here: https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/telemic/research/NetworkedSystems/projects/massive-mimo
2. Download the data set to be proccesed in the same folder with the attached Matlab scripts. <br>
Collocated Data Set: https://owncloud.esat.kuleuven.be/index.php/s/6ogkTwFscfCZLXM <br>
Distributed Data Set: https://owncloud.esat.kuleuven.be/index.php/s/XypP2r7kYi5Y25q 
3. Don't forget to cite our work if any of this data will be used in any kind of publication. <br>
Distributed case: “Hardware and Spectrum Sharing for Distributed Massive MIMO”; Guevara, Andrea P., Cheng-Ming, Chen, Pollin, Sofie; 52nd IEEE Asilomar Conference on Signals Systems and Computers, 28-31 Nov 2018, Pacific Grove CA, USA.



Note: The Matlab scripts in this repository will work only for the previous data set.
